\section{Background}
\label{src:bground}

This section provides a brief introduction to Cray SHMEM.% and an
%overview to the existing memory model in the OpenSHMEM standard
%specification.

\subsection{Cray SHMEM}
\label{src:bg/crayshmem}
OpenSHMEM is a Partitioned Global Address Space~\cite{pgas} (PGAS) library
interface specification.% which is a culmination of a unification effort
%among various vendors and users in the SHMEM programming community.
With a chief aim of performance and portability, OpenSHMEM
provides an Application Programming Interface (API) for SHMEM libraries
to support one-sided point-to-point data communication.
%It follows an SPMD-like execution model.
%, where
%all the processes or Processing Elements(PEs) are launched at the begining
%of the program; each PE executes the same code and the number of PEs remains
%unchanged during the execution of the program. The main features of OpenSHMEM
%API includes the support for:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item remote memory access through one-sided point-to-point blocking and
%    non-blocking communication for both continguous and strided data transfers;
%    \item atomic memory operations;
%    \item collective communication;
%    \item synchronization and memory ordering; and
%    \item mutual exclusion through distributed locking
%\end{itemize}

%There are various optimized production-grade closed source as well as open source
%OpenSHMEM implementations available.
Cray SHMEM~\cite{csma} is a vendor-based
closed source OpenSHMEM implementation from Cray Inc.
It is available as part of
Cray Message Passing Toolkit~\cite{mpt} (MPT). It is OpenSHMEM
specification version-1.3~\cite{osm13} compliant and implemented over
DMAPP~\cite{dmapp}, an
optimized communication layer for Cray architectures. Apart from the OpenSHMEM standard
specific features, it provides support for the following features as \texttt{SHMEMX}
prefixed routines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item thread-safety in Cray SHMEM;
    \item put with signal communication;
    \item PE subsets called as Teams; and
    \item Team-based collective communication routines
\end{itemize}
