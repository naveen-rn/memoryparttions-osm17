\section{Background}
\label{src:bground}

This section provides a brief introduction to Cray SHMEM.% and an
%overview to the existing memory model in the OpenSHMEM standard
%specification.

\subsection{Cray SHMEM}
\label{src:bg/crayshmem}
OpenSHMEM is a Partitioned Global Address Space~\cite{pgas} (PGAS) library
interface specification.% which is a culmination of a unification effort
%among various vendors and users in the SHMEM programming community.
With a chief aim of performance and portability, OpenSHMEM
provides an Application Programming Interface (API) for SHMEM libraries
to support one-sided point-to-point data communication.
%It follows an SPMD-like execution model.
%, where
%all the processes or Processing Elements(PEs) are launched at the begining
%of the program; each PE executes the same code and the number of PEs remains
%unchanged during the execution of the program. The main features of OpenSHMEM
%API includes the support for:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item remote memory access through one-sided point-to-point blocking and
%    non-blocking communication for both continguous and strided data transfers;
%    \item atomic memory operations;
%    \item collective communication;
%    \item synchronization and memory ordering; and
%    \item mutual exclusion through distributed locking
%\end{itemize}

%There are various optimized production-grade closed source as well as open source
%OpenSHMEM implementations available.
Cray SHMEM~\cite{csma} is a vendor-based
closed source OpenSHMEM implementation from Cray Inc.
It is available as part of
Cray Message Passing Toolkit~\cite{mpt} (MPT) software stack. It is
OpenSHMEM
specification version-1.3~\cite{osm13} compliant and implemented over
DMAPP~\cite{dmapp}.DMAPP is an
optimized communication library to support logically shared, distributed
memory programming model on Cray architectures. Apart from the
OpenSHMEM standard
specific features, it provides support for the following features:% as
%\texttt{SHMEMX} prefixed routines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item thread-safety in Cray SHMEM;
    \item put with signal communication;
    \item PE subsets called as Teams; and
    \item Team-based collective communication routines
\end{itemize}
