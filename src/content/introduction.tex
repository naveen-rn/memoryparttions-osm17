\section{Introduction}
\label{src:intro}

Emerging systems support multiple kinds of memory with different
performance and capacity characteristics. For example, the latest
Many Integrated Core (MIC) processor, the Intel Xeon Phi,
code named Knights Landing (KNL)~\cite{KNL}, combines the traditional
off-package DDR memory with the increased high bandwidth on-package
memory called as the Multi-Channel DRAM~\cite{MCDRAM} (MCDRAM). MCDRAM
offers high bandwidth (up to 4X more than DDR4) with limited
capacity (upto 16GB). Vendors provide their own programming approaches
to differentiate these different kinds of memory using external libraries
like CUDA~\cite{cuda}, Memkind~\cite{memkind}. These approaches would
turn applications non-portable. In response, it for the programming
library interfaces like OpenSHMEM~\cite{osm} to provide a more consistent
and portable interface for accessing different kinds of memory on a
tiered memory systems.

In this paper, we define OpenSHMEM runtime changes and extensions to
support different kinds of memory for the symmetric heap. The OpenSHMEM
memory model creates the symmetric heap during the program execution on a
memory location determined by the implementation. The runtime changes
described in this paper would allow users to determine the memory
location at which the symmetric heap can be created. We call these
user-determined memory locations as \emph{Symmetric Memory Partitions}.
Each Memory Partitions feature a list of traits to define their
characteristics and memory kind being one of those featured traits.

The major contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item proposing a set of new runtime changes and extensions in
    OpenSHMEM to support different kinds of memory on tiered systems;
    \item implementation of the proposed feature on
    Cray SHMEM~\cite{csma}, a vendor-specific OpenSHMEM implementation
    from Cray Inc; and
    \item performance analysis of these proposed extensions using
    modified Parallel Research Kernels (ParRes)~\cite{parres} on Intel
    KNL processors as an example use-case for emerging systems.
\end{itemize}

This paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{src:bground} we give a
brief overview on the current OpenSHMEM memory model. In
Section~\ref{src:drelated}, we motivate the need for the symmetric memory
partitions in OpenSHMEM by assessing the performance benefits on using
different kinds of memory on parallel applications using other programming
models like Message Passing Interface~\cite{mpi} (MPI), which already has
support for accessing different kinds of memory. In Section~\ref{src:smempart},
we propose the new runtime changes and extensions in OpenSHMEM to support
different kinds of memory for future emerging systems. In
Section~\ref{src:implement}, we follow up with the implementation of the
proposed changes in Cray SHMEM. In the experimental results presented in
Section~\ref{src:perf} we use the modified ParRes OpenSHMEM kernels for
testing the performance of the proposed routines. We discuss related work
in Section~\ref{src:relate} and we conclude in Section~\ref{src:conclusion}.
