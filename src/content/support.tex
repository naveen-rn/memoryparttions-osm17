\section{Assessing the Need for Heterogeneous Memory Support}
\label{src:drelated}

The STREAM~\cite{stream} benchmark is a simple synthetic benchmark
program that measures the sustainable memory bandwidth and the
corresponding computation rate for simple vector kernels. In this
performance, analysis we have used the MPI version of the STREAM
benchmark to measure the memory bandwidth of the KNL processors
comparing its MCDRAM memory against the DDR4 memory. The experimental
setup used for this analysis includes a 100 node Cray XC30 system
with 64 core KNL processor (7250) per node with each core operating
at 1.4GHz and the nodes connected using Cray developed
Aries~\cite{aries} interconnect. We have used Cray MPICH~\cite{mpt},
an optimized MPI implementation for the Cray architectures.
