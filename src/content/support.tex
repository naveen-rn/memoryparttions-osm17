\section{Assessing the Need for Heterogeneous Memory Support}
\label{src:drelated}

The STREAM~\cite{stream} benchmark is a simple synthetic benchmark
program that measures the sustainable memory bandwidth and the
corresponding computation rate for simple vector kernels. In this
performance analysis, we have used the STREAM benchmark to measure
the memory bandwidth of the KNL processors comparing its MCDRAM memory
against the DDR4 memory. The experimental setup used for this analysis
includes a 100 node Cray XC30 system with 64 core KNL processor (7250)
per node with each core operating at 1.4GHz and the nodes connected
using Cray developed Aries~\cite{aries} interconnect.
