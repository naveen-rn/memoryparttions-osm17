%In this paper we studied the necessity for basic OpenSHMEM changes
%to utilize different kinds of memory.
The need for utilizing different kinds of memory %these features
in upcoming system architectures is not specific to
OpenSHMEM. %Other programming libraries are planning on such similar
%features in their specifications.
%For example,
OpenMP~\cite{openmp} Affinity subcommittee proposes changes
for memory management~\cite{omp-tr5} support for future architectures.
%discuss on the runtime changes
%needed for supporting multiple kinds of memory for future architectures.
Similarly Cray MPICH, an optimized MPI
implementation for Cray systems have improvised the functionality of
\texttt{MPI\_Alloc\_mem} routine for allocating the requested
memory size on user-determined
memory kind. ~\citeauthor{cug17-krishna}
provides detailed explanation on the performance benefits of using
different
memory kinds using \texttt{MPI\_Alloc\_mem} on real world
applications WOMBAT and SNAP.
