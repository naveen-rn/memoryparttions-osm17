In this paper we studied the necessity for basic OpenSHMEM changes
to utilize different kinds of memory. The need for these features
for supporting upcoming system architectures are not specific to
OpenSHMEM. %Other programming libraries are planning on such similar
%features in their specifications.
For example, OpenMP~\cite{openmp} Affinity subcommittee proposes changes
for memory management support for future architectures.
%discuss on the runtime changes
%needed for supporting multiple kinds of memory for future architectures.
Similarly, Cray MPICH which is an optimized MPI
implementation for Cray systems have improvised the functionality of
\texttt{MPI\_Alloc\_mem} to enable users to select the kind of memory to
for allocating the requested memory size. ~\citeauthor{cug17-krishna}
provides detailed explanation on the performance of using different
memory kinds using \texttt{MPI\_Alloc\_mem} on two real world
applications WOMBAT and SNAP.
